This repository contains the code and open access data for the paper titled *Knowledge-based Bi-correction Model for Achieving Effective Lag-free Characteristic on Daily Urban Water Demand Forecasting*. The code is currently unavailable as it is under review for publication. Once the paper is published, we will make the code available in this repository.

Regarding the water demand data, we engaged in multiple thorough discussions with the data custodians. However, permission to publicly release the dataset was not granted. Readers are encouraged to utilize the *electricity* and *exchange rate* datasets for model validation purposes.
